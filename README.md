This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the startup file:

```bash

bash startup.sh
```

Then run the run.sh file

```bash

```

```bash

npx jest

```
